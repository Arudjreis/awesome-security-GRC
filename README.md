# GRC? lol

This is a list of resources (most are free, some are cheap, a handful are expensive) for security GRC folks.

Each of you probably has a different title. Cyber Risk Managers, Security Compliance Program Managers, Business Information Security Officers, Security Risk & Compliance Senior Analysts, Third-Party Risk Management Governance Leads, GRC something, etc.

This variety is naming isn't that great because it's easy for software developers to come together as a community to organize knowledge and share information. A software engineer can be a developer, a software engineer or a software developer. Any sub-sections of this (back-end, front-end, etc.) still means a major trunk of knowledge is useful and relevant to most SWE.

Some of us work for SaaS companies (me! :bowtie:), the financial sector, healthcare, government, retail and a dozen other industries. I would postulate that about 75% to 80% of our work is similar in terms of actual tasks. Scope, budget, stakeholders and degrees of resentment can vary but there's a solid foundation common to most of us.

So I thought, why not build a similar knowledge management platform... I know it's a GitHub repo but that makes my endeavour sound a lot more serious and technical than it actually is. Awesome content curation lists are amazing and I thought we should have one!
