# :tada: Grand Repository Challenge accepted!

This is a list of resources (most are free, some are cheap, a handful are expensive) for security GRC folks.

Each of you probably has a different title. Cyber Risk Managers, Security Compliance Program Managers, Business Information Security Officers, Security Risk & Compliance Senior Analysts, Third-Party Risk Management Governance Leads, GRC something, etc.

This variety is naming isn't that great because it's *easier* for software developers to come together as a community to organize knowledge and share information. A major foundation of knowledge is useful and relevant to most SWE.

Our field is only a couple of decades old and has exponentially developed in the past five years.

Some of us work for SaaS companies (me! :bowtie:), the financial sector, healthcare, government, retail and a dozen other industries. Scope, budget, stakeholders and degrees of resentment can vary but there's a solid foundation common to most of us (let's say about 80%).

So I thought, why not build a similar knowledge management platform... I know it's a GitHub repo but that makes my endeavour sound a lot more serious and technical than it actually is. I just thought content curation lists were amazing and that we should have one!

This is GitHub which means, Pull Requests are more than welcome! 

Feel free to share your resources, correct my faulty Frenglish or add cooler emojis.

# Governance & Audit

## Strategy

Strategy is what's before everything else but probably what's also after everything else. You need it to have the right direction and external inputs are critical for actually choosing the right direction. None of those resources involve reading PPT slides.
