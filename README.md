# :tada: Grand Repository Challenge accepted!

This is a list of resources (most are free, some are cheap, a handful are expensive) for security GRC folks.

Each of you probably has a different title. Cyber Risk Managers, Security Compliance Program Managers, Business Information Security Officers, Security Risk & Compliance Senior Analysts, Third-Party Risk Management Governance Leads, GRC something, etc.

This variety is naming isn't that great because it's *easier* for software developers to come together as a community to organize knowledge and share information. A major foundation of knowledge is useful and relevant to most SWE.

Our field is only a couple of decades old and has exponentially developed in the past five years.

Some of us work for SaaS companies (me! :bowtie:), the financial sector, healthcare, government, retail and a dozen other industries. Scope, budget, stakeholders and degrees of resentment can vary but there's a solid foundation common to most of us (let's say about 80%).

So I thought, why not build a similar knowledge management platform... I know it's a GitHub repo but that makes my endeavour sound a lot more serious and technical than it actually is. I just thought content curation lists were amazing and that we should have one!

This is GitHub which means, Pull Requests are more than welcome! 

Feel free to share your resources, correct my faulty Frenglish or add cooler emojis.

# Governance & Audit

## Strategy

Strategy is what's before everything else but probably what's also after everything else. You need it to have the right direction and external inputs are critical for actually choosing the right direction. None of those resources involve reading PPT slides.

## Getting Buy-in

### Books

[**Measuring and Managing Information Risk**, *Jack Freund & Jack Jones*, 2014](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/measuring-and-managing/9780124202313/)
The FAIR book itself. Self explanatory, if you want to know more about risk quantification this is a must-read, the story in the intro is meme material.

# Career Development

**We are offered jobs but we have a career.** We're the only one accountable for our career path and the best way to make the best of this is to continuously learn.

This section might seem out of place for a content curation repository but I'm passionnate about this, sorry.

Security is a very young field and ours in even younger. Career pathways are still developing and no one *actually* know the sureway to a GRC leadership role or a CISO position.

The only thing that's certain is that this is the best thing that could happen to us. We can build our own paths. The only way we do this is through learning. Our field is about understanding, managing and translating. We understand the technical, manage security projects and translate into security terms business requirements.

If you're a jack-of-all-trades, love learning new things, being inquisitive but always having the business goals in mind, then it's the field for you. If you're not, it's probably the field for you anyway or you wouldn't be here!

## Technical knowledge

Technical knowledge is a very vague concept. Let's categorize that further.

### Networking

### Operating systems

### Development

## Security knowledge

## Business knowledge

## Soft skills
